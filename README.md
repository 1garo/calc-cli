# calc-cli

the idea is to learn ocaml while practicing it doing a cli calculator

## Usage

* Operators 
  * add 
  * sub 
  * mult 
  * div 

#### Before you be able to run the code, you'll need ocaml, opam, and dune:
* [ocaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html)
* [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
* [dune](https://dune.build/install)

*Then you would be able to run:*

``` cd src```

```dune build calc.exe```

```src/_build/default/calc.exe operator number number```
